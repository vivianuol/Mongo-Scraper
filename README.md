# Mongo-Scraper

### tools I used:
* handlebars
* Node/Express
* RestfulAPI
* MongoDB/Mongoose

file structure:
model - define how response data looks like in API, by using Schema(each file create a Schema, describe the properties of the big object). 
model is the agent to connect api data with mongoDB collection.

[this app](https://secret-sands-13857.herokuapp.com/) is deployed on Heroku.
